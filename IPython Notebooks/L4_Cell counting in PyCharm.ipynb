    "The first step before writing any code at all is to think about the algorithm behind the intended analysis. At technical interviews for software engineering positions, interviewers ask for code that will solve a particular problem that they present. Before you even touch the keyboard, you must first think about the problem and the steps that you need to code up to solve the problem. Then you communicate your thought process to the interviewer. It is imperative that you understand what the problem is before you try to solve it. \n",
